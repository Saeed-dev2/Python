# 🏷️ Label Encoding with Python

This project demonstrates how to perform **label encoding** using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. Label encoding is a data preprocessing technique used in machine learning to convert categorical labels into numeric form so that algorithms can work effectively with the data.

## 📁 File Description

- `Label_Encoding.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that contains Python code for performing label encoding on a sample dataset using `pandas`.

---

## 📚 Objectives

- Understand the concept of label encoding
- Create a sample dataset with categorical features
- Apply label encoding using different methods
- Analyze the effects of encoding on the dataset

---

## 🔧 Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

### 1. Import Libraries

The notebook starts by importing necessary libraries:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

### 2. Create a Dataset

A sample dataset is created with one or more categorical columns that require encoding. These columns represent categories like `Country`, `Color`, `Gender`, etc.

### 3. Perform Label Encoding

Label encoding is applied using:
- `pandas.factorize()`
- `pandas.Categorical().codes`

Example:
```python
df['encoded'] = pd.factorize(df['category_column'])[0]
```

### 4. Compare Encoded Results

The encoded results are compared with the original data to understand the transformation.

---

## 📈 Use Cases of Label Encoding

- Preparing categorical data for machine learning models
- Converting textual class labels to integers
- Encoding target labels in supervised learning

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Ensure that the categorical variables are ordinal if using Label Encoding.
- For nominal (non-ordered) categories, consider using **One-Hot Encoding** to prevent unintended ordinal relationships.

---

## 📌 Note

Label Encoding assigns each unique category value an integer, which can introduce unintended order relationships. Be cautious when using it with nominal data.
